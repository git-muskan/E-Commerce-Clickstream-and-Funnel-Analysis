# E-Commerce-Clickstream-and-Funnel-Analysis

## Project Background

This project focuses on understanding user behavior in an e-commerce setting by analyzing clickstream data and constructing a detailed funnel analysis. The goal was to uncover patterns in how users move through key funnel stages — from viewing a product to carting and purchasing — and to identify where users drop off. Understanding why users drop off before completing a purchase is critical for any e-commerce platform. 
Clickstream-based funnel analysis is crucial for diagnosing bottlenecks in the user journey, uncovering performance gaps by brand, price, category, or time, and ultimately guiding strategic decisions to improve conversion rates.

## Project Overview

This project uses Python, MySQL, and Tableau to analyze millions of user events from an e-commerce platform over two months. The focus is on understanding how users move through the funnel — from viewing products to adding them to the cart and eventually purchasing. A large amount of clickstream data i.e 8.7M logs were imported, cleaned, and then furthur the funnel was created in MySQL to optimize and streamline the process for furthur indepth analysis which was conducted in Python. The key insights gained were displayed through a Tableau dashboard by using various plots and visualizations.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- MySQL
- Tableau

## Business Questions

The project aimed to answer key business questions, including:

- Where do most users drop off in the purchase funnel?
- Which product categories and price ranges perform best in conversions?
- Which brands receive high attention but fail to convert and why?
- Are there peak hours or days for conversions?
- How does pricing influence cart and purchase behavior?

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Through the analysis of the clickstream data, we've uncovered various insights which can ultimately help us improving the future business decisions and helped us identify key points in the user journey where attention is lost and surfaced actionable patterns in product pricing, brand trust, and timing.
The insights suggest that focusing on improving product discovery and early engagement, optimizing pages for highly viewed but underperforming brands, running campaigns during peak conversion windows etc. could significantly improve overall funnel efficiency.

- 78.6% of sessions were view-only, with only 2.9% resulting in purchases — signaling major drop-off early in the funnel.
- Mid-priced items (₹25–₹100) had the highest conversion rates, indicating pricing sweet spots.
- Some brands attracted high user engagement but showed extremely low purchase conversion — suggesting possible issues in trust, pricing, or product pages.
- Cart-to-purchase conversion was relatively strong, implying that addressing early-funnel engagement (views → carts) could yield greater overall impact.
- Conversions peaked midweek during afternoon hours, highlighting ideal campaign timing.
